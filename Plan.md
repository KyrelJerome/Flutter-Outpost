# Project Roadmap

## Project Description
Flutter Outpost is a data collection tool designed for large groups of people to collect data in an organized, streamlined manner through templated data and formatted by a central organization. 
The main usage of Flutter-Outpost is it's ability to fully function offline, allowing for teams to offload datasets and compiled "reports"  to a team coach or set of team members on the fly, allowing for all members of the team to keep up to date simply by "word of mouth", a logic shared fromt he cuban "shoenet".

## Project Outline
Note: Templates of all types are held in an "outpost", a system akin to discord and slack's "channels",
where outposts operate independently from all other outposts, and invite keys are given to members who wish to download and decrypt the outpost.

### Phase One (Templating) *50%
1. Templates for data collection
2. Data Type Templates for data collection (Numerical, Ordinal, Bounded Numerical, Text), 
3. Report Templates.
4. Create a Save system for templates, Outposts can be held in their own sub folders for now.

### Phase Two (UI) 
1. UI Components, create a general "Template" Widget, that uses a Widget factory to build widgets depending on the given template.
2. Create a UI for inputting digits
3. Design 

### Phase Three (Data Transfer & Sharing)
1. Create a system for porting entire folders between Outposts through android NFC
2. Create a system for finding the most recently changed and added
3. Create a security system for data transfer.
4. Create Outpost Hosts, members and etc privileges.

### Phase Four Outline (Automatic Data)
1. Create a UI for adding REST pulls to the central outpost.
